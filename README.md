### **Lead the army of the undead.**  
As the Necromancer, you don't engage in direct combat. Instead, command undead units to fend off enemies approaching from all directions.

### **For the Necromancer, corpses are opportunities.**  
Every enemy slain becomes a potential recruit for your undead army. Revive these bodies at critical moments to turn the tide of battle.

### **Face powerful foes who challenge your reign.**  
Special enemies will appear to test your strength. However, once defeated, they too can be resurrected to fight for you as part of your ever-growing undead legion.

### **Become the ultimate Necromancer by making smart choices.**  
Each Necromancer has a unique approach to combat. As you raise and sacrifice your undead minions, you'll be presented with choices to strengthen your forces. 

- **Evolve your army** by choosing specific enhancements for different undead types.
- **Strategize synergies** between undead units to build the most powerful legion.
- **Dominate the battlefield** by ensuring your undead are unstoppable.

Do whatever it takes to survive until the end!
