# NecroRumble
[Krafton Jungle Game Lab] Epic Project: Top-Down  Strategy Rogue-like

##ABOUT THIS GAME

###Resurrect the corpses to build your army, defeat the mortals, and survive to the end!



###Lead the army of the undead.
In our game, the Necromancer doesn't engage in direct combat.
Instead, utilize undead units to fend off enemies approaching from all directions.




###For the Necromancer, the corpses of enemies are potential troops.
Revive these bodies at critical moments to turn the tide of battle in your favor.




###Special enemies will appear to challenge you.
However, once defeated and turned into corpses, they too can be resurrected as part of your undead legion.

Do whatever it takes to survive until the last.



###Choose your rewards wisely to evolve into the ultimate Necromancer!
Every Necromancer has a unique approach to combat.
As you create and sacrifice undead, you'll be presented with choices to strengthen your undead forces.

Through these enhancements, decide which type of undead in your legion will become more powerful and how to boost their abilities.

Consider the synergies between different undead types to build a formidable army and engage in battle.
